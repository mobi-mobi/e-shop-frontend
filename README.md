# e-shop-frontend
My new e-shop project in react and express js
=======
# React + Vite

Finally finished this e-shop that i've been working on for the past 3? weeks. Learned a lot about react and express js. I guess i could create more components for admin and products page but i'll probably tidy up the code after some break. This is only the frontend side. I'll push the backend on the other repo. Overally im really happy with this project. Finally finished something more "complex".
